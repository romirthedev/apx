        <h2>Derivatives:</h2>
        <p>The derivative of x^n with respect to x is nx^(n-1). (e.g., d/dx (x^3) = 3x^2)</p>
        <p>The derivative of sin(x) with respect to x is cos(x).</p>
        <p>The derivative of e^x with respect to x is e^x.</p>

        <h2>Integrals:</h2>
        <p>The integral of x^n with respect to x is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C (for n ≠ -1). (e.g., ∫ x^2 dx = (x^3)/3 + C)</p>
        <p>The integral of cos(x) with respect to x is sin(x) + C.</p>
        <p>The integral of 1/x with respect to x is ln|x| + C.</p>

        <p>These are fundamental rules in calculus that help determine rates of change and accumulated quantities. Understanding these basic forms is essential for tackling more complex problems in both differentiation and integration.</p>
